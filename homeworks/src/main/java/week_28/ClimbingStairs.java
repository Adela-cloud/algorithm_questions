/**
 * Simba has a number of staircases in his house, and he likes to climb each staircase 1 or 2 steps at a time.
 * It takes n steps to reach the top. In how many distinct ways can he climb to the top?
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 2 Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
 * 1. 1 step + 1 step
 * 2. 2 steps
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 3 Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
 * 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
 * 2. 1 step + 2 steps
 * 3. 2 steps + 1 step
 * Constraints:
 * ï‚· 1 <= n <= 45
